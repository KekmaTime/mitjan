# Mitjan

Mitjan is a GitHub bot designed to notify maintainers when a pull request gets approved.

## How it Works

Mitjan monitors pull requests in a GitHub repository and sends notifications to the designated maintainers when a pull request receives approval. The bot automates the process of notifying maintainers, saving time and ensuring prompt communication.

## Getting Started

To use Mitjan in your GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Add Mitjan as a collaborator or deploy it as a GitHub App in your repository.

2. **Configuration**: Set up the necessary configuration for Mitjan, such as the list of maintainers to be notified. This can typically be done through a configuration file or by modifying the bot's settings.

3. **Permissions**: Ensure that Mitjan has appropriate permissions to access the necessary repositories, pull requests, and approval events.

4. **Testing**: Create a test pull request and simulate an approval to verify that Mitjan correctly detects and notifies the maintainers.

5. **Deployment**: If you're using Mitjan as a GitHub App, make sure it is properly deployed and configured to receive webhook events from your repository.

6. **Monitor**: Keep an eye on Mitjan's notifications to ensure that maintainers are being alerted when pull requests are approved. Adjust any settings or configurations as needed.
